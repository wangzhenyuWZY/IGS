                        justswap).<br>Gnomes value is same as GLDE value (1 Gnome = 1 GLDE).<br>Dragons value is same as
                        GLDE + GLDI value (1 Dragon = 1 GLDE + 1 GLDI).<br>Fairies value is same as GLDI value (1 Fairy
                        = 1 GLDI).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What is the difference between Animals Farms and Magical Farms?</strong><br>Animals
                        Farms (Chickens, Gooses, Bunnies, Flamingos, Penguins) are acquired by spending TRX, those TRX
                        are injected into the GLDE and GLDI liquidity pools. These liquidity pool&nbsp; release a
                        special kind of token (Liquidity Tokens), that are the Animals. Thus, Animals value are tied to
                        liquidity. Since liquidity in Goldeneggs Dapp is locked by default, Animals value tend to remain
                        quite stable.<br>Magical Farms (Gnomes, Fairies, Dragons) are acquired by spending Tokens (GLDE
                        or GLDI), those Tokens are locked forever in the farm contract (burned). Thus, Magical Entities
                        (Gnomes, Fairies, Dragons) value is tied to the Tokens value. Since GLDE and GLDI price depend
                        exclusively from supply and demand (how the community interact with the tokens), their value
                        tend to be more volatile and much less stable compared to Animals (LP tokens) value.<br>Animals
                        are much safer and tend to offer a lower APY.<br>Magicals are more riskious but offer higher
                        APY.&nbsp;

                    is a DeFi ecosystem composed of two Defi Tokens and three Farming contracts, hosted on the Tron
                    Blockchain, transparent and opensource. It is the first Defi Dapp that is easy to use, thanks to the
                    "One Click Staking" function, and safe thanks to it's embedded secured-liquidity mechanism. All
                    liquidity is always locked forever, by default.&nbsp;This offers a great protection against
                    impermanent losses also known as "rug pull", since nobody can take advantage of the system. Golden
                    Eggs and Golden Diamonds price is totally dictated by supply and demand dynamics, the whole dapp is
                    fully decentralized all the time. Golden Eggs can be bought and sold at any time, and they can be
                    also used to farm Golden Diamonds! Golden Diamonds can be bought and sold at any time!<br></h3>
